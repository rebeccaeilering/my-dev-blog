Another year has passed by and it has been, what you can say, an interesting year for better or worse. The first six months hummed along and honestly I don't remember much of it. It seems like years ago. Then between March and June I worked from home. Staring in June we came back to the office once the stay at home orders were lifted. In case I forget, we are in the middle of the Covid-19 global pandemic. 

I'm going to be gentle on myself as because of the pandemic everything seems more stressful. 

Overall, I'm still focusing on improving my JavaScript skill and I do feel like I'm making steady progress. I still struggle with confidence and what people call imposter syndrome. I think I just need to accept I'm going to have these feelings and just cope. 

What have I learned this year?

* Still getting better with JavaScript and have progessed into learning more server side JavaScript. Specificall learning more Node.js. I've learned to set up a local server with Express. I've also learned how to port in data from a database (MongoDB) and render that with server-side code. 
* CSS is getting easier and easier but as it's getting easier, I'm learning to do more complex things with it. I'm discovering more pseudo-elements, functions, and also gaining more deep knowledge on how it all works. I feel like I can explain what I'm doing and why. 
* As I get better at CSS and JavaScript, I feel more confident with accessibility and creating more accessible code.
* I still write down my daily accomplishments. Since I'm still doing it, I feel like there's worth in it. I do think it gives me perspective.

* I think I'm getting better at talking on the phone with clients.

Now that another year has passed, what do I hope to accomplish in the next year?

* More site construction projects. I didn't do much on that front except help with projects. At this point, with being in support, I don't think that's going to happen unless we get another support person.
* I want to continue to develop my skills with JavaScript. I've been working with Node.js and want to continue with that. I'm in the process of learning how to implement authentication using Node and JSON Web Tokens. In addition, I've been learning Svelte. 
* I'm going to continue to work on my confidence and not allowing myself to get too down on myself when I feel like I can't solve an issue.
* I need to speak up more in meetings and share ideas and thoughts more. I think I need to start writing things down.
* I'd like more billable hours but that's all dependent on how much work comes in. Plus I'm getting faster at solving issues so I take on more issues but solve them faster. 
* As for phone skills, I think I still need improvements on support calls in which I am not knowledgeable about the issue.
