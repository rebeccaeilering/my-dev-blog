Like last year, I'm going to set some goals for the year. Five total. Here we go.

1. I want to use more animation. I would like to dive more into CSS animations. One thing I'd like to do is remove the Animate.css from my website and just code my own animations. That's one less third party and http request. Overall, though, I want to add a little more small details to make UIs more interesting.

2. I want to continue to focus on JavaScript. Specifically ES6. I've made a lot of progress last year with jQuery/JavaSript and I would like to keep up the momentum. It would be nice to replace some of the other third party stuff on my website with my own code. I've been using Gatsby for this blog since midway through last year and I would like to continue to gain understanding of what makes it work and customizing my blog.

3. In VSCode, use more shortcuts and code snippets to speed up productivity. I use a handful of keyboard shortcuts but I think I can make use of more and speed my development process up a little.

4. I didn't do so well with this one last year but create something using a programming language I don't know. Most likely it will be something server side. Another option would be to get into Node.js.

5. Give my blog a new name and a "real" domain name.

Ultimately, I could just say to just continue to get better with JavaScript, accessibility. In addtion, I want to do more interesting things with CSS.
