Like last year, I'm going to set some goals for the year. Five total. Here we go.

1. I want to explore and learn more of Svelte.js and maybe some other framework stuff. The plan is to do more tutorials and then come up with a new project or go back to my Whale Sightings project and implement what I learned.

2. I would like to possibly transfer my St. Louis photos project into an Express/Node project. Basically do the photo galleries server-side.

3. In VSCode I want to use more shortcuts and code snippets to speed up productivity. I use a handful of keyboard shortcuts but I think I can make use of more and speed my development process up a little.

4. Level up my Javascript skill. This seems like more of an ongoing goal and that is true. I'm not sure what I want to learn specifically yet but I want the majority of what I do this year to revolve around JavaScript. I want the easier, common stuff to come easier. I want to do things are are more challenging too. I just want to level up.

5.
