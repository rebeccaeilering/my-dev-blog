Another year has past by. Since last year, our department has moved into a new building and I'm getting used to living in a smaller city. I've still struggled with my confidence but I've been taking steps to work on that. I've given a lot of focus to getting better at JavaScript. In fact we're making the transition to using the ES6 syntax and moving away from jQuery. I like that becuase I can more-or-less just focus on raw JavaScript.

What have a learned this year?

* I still have a lot to learn but I always will have a lot to learn because web development is always evolving.
* I'm better a JavaScript than I was last year. I'm more confident and I'm more willing to take on issues and soving problems with JS.
* I can do about anything in CSS and I feel more comfortable with more complex stuff like animations, using pseudo selectors, calc functions, transforms, etc,...
* Accessibility is getting easier. I still get confused and have to ask questions but I certainly understand the Aria attribute and other accessibility attributes more.
* I write down my daily accomplishments. This has helped me see the things I do on a daily basis that I succeed at. It has helped me see that I make progress every day and will eventually solve any issues I'm having. It's a confidence booster.
* Along with writing JavaScript, I'm getting better at debugging it. 
* A lot of the same things from last year apply. (add link to last year's post)

Now that another year has past, what do I hope to accomplish in the next year?

* More site construction projects. I didn't do much on that front except help with projects. However, I built a lot of marketing landing pages this year.
* I want to continue to develop my skills with JavaScript. I want to get better with APIs, higher order functions. On a personal level I want to learn more about server side JS (Node.js). The main thing is to keept building stuff.
* Still work on my confidence and not get so frustrated when I don't solve problems as quickly as I'd like to.
* Ask more questions.
* Learn more because I'm never going to know everything.
* Use my standing desk more.
