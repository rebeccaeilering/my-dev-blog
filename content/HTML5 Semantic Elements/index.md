A long time ago it was pretty standard to create layouts with tables. Then we moved on to using divs combined with css to create layouts. This was certainly better than tables but no consideration was given to accessibility. I don't even think it was an afterthought. I think it literally wasn't thought about. 

You can still create website layouts with nothing but div tags (I don't recommend it). You could make the div layouts more friendly to screen readers and other assistive technologies by using role attributes. You can still do that but today you can use semantic sectioning elements such as `<main>`, `<header>`,`<nav>`,`<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>` to organize your content. There are other elements too. You can explore those here (add link). I just want to focus on the one's used for layout.

##Main

##Header

##Nav

##Section

##Article

##Aside

##Footer
