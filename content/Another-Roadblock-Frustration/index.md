I did it again. I found myself losing my temper and then going into a downward spiral of sadness and regret. I've been struggling with a html email (go figure) and I just completely lost it. 

I have been working on a html email off and on over the past week. It's been a pretty difficult layout and I've been struggling with it. Plus, not getting much help. The issue is mostly when I test it by sending emails to my Outlook and to the Gmail accounts. I haven't been getting any kind of consistancy. When I'm coding and looking at my updates in the browser, it's fine. It's when they go to an email client. They turn into a steaming pile of dung.

This was my issue the other day. I had some time at the end of the day so I was going to put some time into it. As hours pass, my frustrations are building. By 5 pm, which is the end of the day, I'm furious and cursing. I'm about ready to throw something. My stomach feels sick. I stay late to hopefully make a breakthrough but it just wasn't happening. I at least kept my "cool" at work.

I rode my bike home. I was fuming. I got home and just started yelling at anything and everything. Yelling at my partner, at my cat, at my computer. I may have threw a couple things - like my shoes. I scared the cat. I cried. I was then on my computer and Safari was giving me problems so the yelling started again. The crying started. Ugly crying. Self-defeated crying.

By the end of the night, I felt horrible. Sick. I decided I hated my job and didn't want to go back. I decided I was not cut out for this. I'm never going to be good at this. I will always struggle with the easiest of issues. I decided I was going to tell my PM I couldn't do this. The I went to be early.

## Next Day

I woke up pissed. I didn't eat breakfast unless you call JuJu Fish "breakfast". I begrudgingly put my cloths on and shuffled to work. Angry and defeated and going over how I wanted to tell my PM that I couldn't complete this. I failed. I feel miserable.

I don't know how I do it. I manage to put one foot forward and move on one tip-toe at a time. I had several small tasks to handle in the morning. I was confident I could do those. Of course, I slam myself for this, "the only thing you can do is simple stuff like add images or copy/paste some scripts or edit content". You're no real developer. You're just a code monkey who does menial support work. 

## Lessons

I don't know. I fall into this pit everytime I get stuck on something. I especailly lose it with html emails. I don't know how to be more patient and kind to myself. I do eventually get through my issue but it exhausts me. I am exhausted right now. I feel ashamed and defeated. I wish I had a lession I could tell people. I don't. I still haven't figured it out. I wish I could list "5 sure-fire ways to be more patient with yourself" or "hear is how to defeat imposter syndrome". I can't write that becuase I don't know and I haven't found a good way to cope yet.

Generally I just feel like crap until I don't. I pack the feelings up and try to forget about it. I move on for a little bit until the next crisis. Wash, rince, and repeat the same mistakes.
