Until recently, I never thought much about printing out a web page. I guess it's something people do. I know you can. I just never do. That said, I never thought about creating styling for print. I thought it would be difficult but it was actually not that difficult.

First, I found this great resource from Smashing Magazine. [A Guide To The State Of Print Stylesheets In 2018](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/print-stylesheets-in-2018/)

## Why create print stylesheets?

I think the biggest thing I notice is that it cleans things up a bit. Websites have navigation, sidebars, advertisements, large images and graphics, videos and other elements that are not going to translate well or are irrelevant to print. You probably don't want to print an embedded YouTube video. What's the point of that? We really just want the meat of the content. I also like to remove most color elements and keep the print black just so I'm not forcing you to use our precious color ink.

### What about links?

While links are not functional when in print we don't want to remove those in all instances. Using css we can insert link urls into the text as a reference.

## How to get started?
