{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>By now we're all aware of the COVID-19 outbreak and most of us are taking measures to help stop the spread of this new illness. This has created a lot of uncertainty and is forcing us to change how we are living our lives. A lot of us are taking measures to distance ourselves from other people. Some of these measures are personal choices - like self-quarantining. Here in Illinois, there have been mass cancellations of events. Schools are shut down. Restaurants and Bars have been forced by the state to close (except delivery and take-out) to stop the spread. Many places of work, that have the ability, are having their employees work from home. </p>\n<p>On March 16th, my place of employment mandated that we work from home until the end of this month (edit: updated to End of May). We have always had the ability to work from home every-once-in-awhile but my employer mostly wants us in the office. However making this transition hasn't been too difficult for my company. For us individual workers it has been quite a change. I am going to note that I have worked from home with a previous employer but this seems different. On the first day of remote working I had to dismantle my entire office. That was just disconnecting my monitors, getting my dock, getting some monitor stands, making sure I have all my cords, pack up my mouse, keyboard, headphones, and notebooks and taking it home. Then reassemling in an extra bedroom. Thank goodness I have a nice desk and chair already!</p>\n<p>What I was most worried about was connecting to our company's VPN to get to certain files and push out updates to demo and production servers. Since I was hired I never worked at home and therefore have never used the VPN. I had no idea how to connect. Thank goodness I asked but also leaders within my department emailed some FAQs and inviting questions and helping us if needed. In addition, I had no idea how we would handle our phone system. I learned how to forward my calls to my mobile and the company was working on getting support calls to automatically create tickets within our system. In the end all that technical stuff worked out.</p>\n<p>However, because we have clients who are worried and are within industries that are important in this crisis such as health care and banking we were getting bombarded with urgent and high priority requests. So I was glad the transition went well so we could help our clients that need to put out important information out to the public. This is especially true for the hospitals we work with becuase they are on the front lines of this health crisis.</p>\n<p>I want to note that I started writing this in March and haven't touched this post until today. My work has been up and down in the way of having things to do. I'm used to working at home now and mostly have kept up with everthing but I don't feel like this has been a breeze. In fact I feel stressed out all the time. I feel disconnected with my co-workers and don't like reaching out over chat. </p>\n<p>Is there anything I've learned in since March 16th? Sure. I need to take this one day at a time. I need to realize that my productivity is not going to be as good - I get distracted more, I get stressed and irritated more easily (which means I got to get up and take a break). I've learned to just accept that there are going to be days where I'm worried, stressed and I'm not going to be as clear headed as I could be.</p>\n<p>I will say this. I have retained some of the things from when I used to work remote. I get dressed every day. I go out for walks. I eat lunch at the same time every day. Essentially I have a routine and that helps.</p>\n<p>Until the shelter-in-place order is lifted, remote working will be the normal. When I'm able to get back to the office it's going to feel new - like I'm going to feel like a new employee in a new building and, again, there will be some re-adjustments but I'll be happy to get back to some semblance of normal.</p>","timeToRead":3,"excerpt":"By now we're all aware of the COVID-19 outbreak and most of us are taking measures to help stop the spread of this new illness.
