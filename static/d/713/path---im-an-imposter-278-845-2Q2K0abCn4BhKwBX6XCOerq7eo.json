{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I'm not a developer. I have told myself this a million times. I think if you read the My Dev Journey post, that could give some guidance to why I may feel that way. I didn't go into being a developer by the normal and traditional route. I'm self taught and that give me doubts that I'm doing things the \"right way\". I often feel like I don't know as much as others. I'm sure that is true but I'm sure I also know more than some other people too.</p>\n<p>A fear I have a lot is talking to other developers. I'm fearful of seeming like a noob, or claiming to know stuff I don't. I may say that I'm a developer but am I a \"real\" developer? I can admit that sometimes I'm scared of asking questions or scared of being wrong or not being able to solve a problem at work and being judged by others as \"She doesn't know what she's doing. What an idiot.\" or wonder, \"How on Earth did you get this job?\". </p>\n<p>The truth will come out. I'm stupid and don't know how to code. I somehow tricked everyone that interviewed me. I deviously said the right things and manipulated them. Maybe I'm an affirmative action hire to provide more diversity. Either way, at the core is that \"I don't deserve what I have\".</p>\n<p>That is bullshit. </p>\n<p>Still the thought creeps back into my head, \"or maybe there is some truth to it and I don't know anything and I was a diversity hire and they put up with me despite being an idiot\". In the end I just have to ignore those creeping thoughts and just do my job and not worry about it cause worrying about it doesn't help in any way.</p>\n<p>The truth is that I can't control how anyone else thinks and if they do think negative of me then \"screw them\". All I can do is do my best and continue to learn. I will make mistakes. Those judging me will make mistakes too. Everyone makes errors.</p>\n<p>Things to remember:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I can't control how others feel. I can only control how I feel and how they feel is not my problem.</li>\n<li>I can just work on doing my best. Don't be lazy. Take pride in your work.</li>\n<li>You don't know everything and that is ok. Be open. Take criticism. Learn.</li>\n<li>Accept and acknowledge mistakes. It's ok to fail.</li>\n<li>Take notice and try to remember successes no matter how small they may seem.</li>\n<li>Baby steps are ok. As long as you work on the skill and practice, you will get better.</li>\n<li>If you didn't take a traditional route to being a developer, it doesn't mean you're less valuable. In a way you bring something else to the table they may not. You may see problems and solutions others may not see. Life experiences outside of programming/development/code do count and should count.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the end. Yes, I am a developer.</p>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"I'm not a developer.
