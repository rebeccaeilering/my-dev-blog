{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>A long time ago it was pretty standard to create layouts with tables. Then we moved on to using divs to create layouts. This was certainly better than tables but no consideration was given to accessibility. However, today, accessibility is very important to create websites that will be accessible by all. This means making it so a website allows assistive technologies to read your site and adapt it so those with a variety of disabilities can access the content of a website.</p>\n<p>You can still create website layouts with nothing but div tags (I don't recommend it). You could make the div layouts more friendly to screen readers and other assistive technologies by using role attributes to create landmarks that are used by assistive technologies. You may still do that but using semantic sectioning elements such as <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;header&gt;</code>,<code class=\"language-text\">&lt;nav&gt;</code>,<code class=\"language-text\">&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;aside&gt;</code> to organize your content is a better option. </p>\n<p>Why is it better? First as a developer, it is easier to read. Instead of a sea of nested div tags that don't have any meaning, you have names for tags that have a clear meaning. When scanning code it sure is easier finding a footer tag than it is to find a div tag with a class or id with the name \"footer\". Secondly, some of the semantic sectioning elements behave like landmark roles. Landmark roles help assisstive technologies identify and navigate to sections of an HTML document. In the end by using semantic sectioning elements you use less code to do the same thing. For example, <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;main&gt;...&lt;/main&gt;</code> vs <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;div role=&quot;main&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>. However, in some cases you may have to do something like this <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;main role=&quot;main&quot;&gt;...&lt;/main&gt;</code> if you support legacy browsers like Internet Explorer.</p>\n<p>So what do the following do?</p>\n<h2 id=\"main\"><a href=\"#main\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Main</h2>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;main&gt;</code> element is where the dominant content of the document's body lives.

Typically if you use a section, you'll have more than one section (not always though). Many mistakenly use this element as a generic container - like a <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;div&gt;</code>. A section element is to be used if the content should logically appear in the outline of the HTML document. Sections should have a heading as a child element. Sections may contain <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;footer&gt;</code> tags but it's not nessessary. Sections may also contain articles. </p>\n<p>A section is not a landmark but it becomes one when a heading is used along with an <code class=\"language-text\">aria-label</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">aria-labelledby</code>, or <code class=\"language-text\">title</code> attribute.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section\">Learn more about the Section tag</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"article\"><a href=\"#article\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Article</h2>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;article&gt;</code> element is often confused with the <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;section&gt;</code> element. The <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;article&gt;</code> element is a self-contained composition in a document that may be reusable/repeatable. Many times this is used for blog posts or news articles. How I usually think of it is that an article can be independent and taken outside the context of the page and still make sense.</p>\n<p>Sections and articles may be nested inside an article. Header and footer tags can be used inside of articles too. In addtion, articles should have a heading as a child element.</p>\n<p>Articles are not landmarks and should be within a landmark.

It's not another term for sidebar but many times it is used for a sidebar. It's often used as call-outs, definitions, and other auxiliary content. This landmark contains content that is indirectly related to the documents main content. If the content is not in any way related to the main content a <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;div&gt;</code> element may be more appropriate.</p>\n<p>An Aside can have an header and footer but can't contain another aside element.</p>\n<p>Before HTML5, <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;aside&gt;</code> would be written like <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;div role=&quot;complimentary&quot;&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside\">Learn more about the Aside tag</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"footer\"><a href=\"#footer\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Footer</h2>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;footer&gt;</code> element is commonly at the bottom of a page ouside of the main content.
