{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>For a couple weeks my blog completely disappeared resulting in the link to my blog from my website being broke.</p>\n<p>This resulted from my purchase of a new MacBook Air(MBA) and not being able to get Jekyll installed. The problem wasn't Jekyll itself but with Ruby. My MBA runs MacOS Mojove and a version of Ruby that doesn't meet Jekyll's minimum system requirements. I tried following the directions on the <a href=\"Jekyll%20website&#x27;s%20documentation\">https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/</a> and didn't understand it. I understook installing Homebrew and got a version of Ruby installed. However, I now have two version installed and can't figure out how to run the correct on.</p>\n<p>I specifically don't understand this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">// add the brew ruby path to your shell config\nexport PATH=/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH</code></pre></div>\n<p>I don't understand this either:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">// append your path file with the following, replacing the X.X with the first two digits of your Ruby version\nexport PATH=$HOME/.gem/ruby/X.X.0/bin:$PATH</code></pre></div>\n<p>Anyway, my level of frustration was high and I just decided to kill it. Start over. I wiped out the repo and rendered the site as dead.</p>\n<h2 id=\"move-to-gatsby\"><a href=\"#move-to-gatsby\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Move to Gatsby</h2>\n<p>On my new computer, I had no issues with Gatsby. After all it's just javascript. I installed node.js and then the Gatsby CLI and I was ready. It all works so I have been transferring my everything from my Jekyll build to the Gatsby build.</p>\n<p>Overall it's been simple and relatively painless. I don't have a huge amount of posts so that wasn't a problem. The biggest job was just getting the structure and styling in place.  Again, this wasn't that difficult and in the meantime I made a few changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thoughts-of-jekyll\"><a href=\"#thoughts-of-jekyll\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Thoughts of Jekyll</h2>\n<p>I did like it and when I started using it the Liquid code sort of reminded my of PHP and at my previous job we built sites on PHP. Since starting my new job, I haven't touched PHP. However, my biggest hurdle with Jekyll was Ruby. I just don't know much about it and it's not a learning path I was wanting to take. In the end, my investment in javascript is high and for me it just makes more sense to build in the javascript/React/Gatsby ecosystem. It's just more relevant to me.</p>\n<p>I don't think Jekyll is bad but I do feel like there are more hurdles if you're not familiar with Liquid or Ruby. </p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-built-this\"><a href=\"#how-i-built-this\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How I Built This</h2>\n<p>When I built my blog on Jekyll I just modified the default theme which is called Minima. It doesn't have a lot of features built in. I had to build my own categories functionality. I wasn't doing a huge amount of customization. I was just adding features and functionality as I went along.</p>\n<p>When moving to Gatsby, I suppose I could have just built from the starter theme which I think is about as minimal as the default theme. Actually, I think the Gatsby starter is even more minimal. That said, I decided to add a different starter theme. I am using <a href=\"Gatsby-Advanced-Starter\">https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter</a>. The main thing was it has all the blog functionality but very little styling and html structure. It probably has more features that I need but I also like how it has SEO and social features built in.</p>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"For a couple weeks my blog completely disappeared resulting in the link to my blog from my website being broke.
