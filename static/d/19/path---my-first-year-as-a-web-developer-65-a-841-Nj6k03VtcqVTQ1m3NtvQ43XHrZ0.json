{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>A year ago today I started working as an associate web developer. Overall, it's been a good year. It's also been a year full of big challenges and changes that included moving to a new city. I've learned a ton. Sometimes I feel confident. Other times I don't.</p>\n<p>In the year that I have worked as a developer, what have I learned? </p>\n<ul>\n<li>I know more than I think I do.</li>\n<li>I don't know that much.</li>\n<li>Ask questions.</li>\n<li>Seek help if you're stuck. Don't dwell on an issue for hours. </li>\n<li>I can fix little issues in C# and VB. I can't do anything too complicated but there are somethings I can figure out just by looking at the code.</li>\n<li>When estimating, go with the higher number.</li>\n<li>Take breaks. Get up every-so-often. Take your full lunch break and go for a walk after eating. It's a good way to reset for the second half of the day. It's also handy when you get frustrated and angry. It's better than crying in your cube.</li>\n<li>Make lists. Yeah, we have project management apps, help desk apps. However I find writing and prioritizing my tasks for the day helps keep me focused. Plus I feel like I'm actually accomplishing something when I cross off items.</li>\n<li>Call the client if messaging and emails don't get their attention.</li>\n<li>I'm better at JavaScript than I used to be. I still suck at it though.</li>\n<li>I love HTML/CSS. </li>\n<li>The importance of accessibility and semantic code.</li>\n<li>Drink lots of water. Stay hydrated and you'll have to use the restroom at some point so it will force you to get up.</li>\n<li>Wear headphones even if you aren't listening to anything.</li>\n<li>Getting to work 20-30 min early gives me time to warm up. I like to read articles on front-end development or look at CodePen.</li>\n<li>Living close to where you work rocks. I can ride my bike and it's saving me lots of money.</li>\n<li>I'm terrible at golf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that I have worked a full year as a developer, what do I hope to accomplish in the next year?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More site construction projects. I built a few sites this year but mostly just did tons fo support and small projects.</li>\n<li>I want to get more skilled with JavaScript. I don't expect expert level but I certainly want to tackle more.</li>\n<li>I did great on my billable hours and I want to keep that up and get more!</li>\n<li>I want to not get so frustrated when I can't figure out a complex problem easily. I need to be more patient with myself.</li>\n<li>Ask more questions.</li>\n<li>Learn more because I'm never going to know everything.</li>\n<li>Realize when things go wrong it's not always my fault.</li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":2,"excerpt":"A year ago today I started working as an associate web developer.
